compMNIST_steps: apply two transformations sequentially to one digit-> we try to make the model distinguish the rules
operation vector: concat 2 4 dim one-hot vactors -> 100 dim rep and then cat it to the digit-entity 
	(4 first dim transformation in first step, 4 second dim transformation in second step)
	
choose rule at each step with 200 dim entity and expect rule network to add second step information for different second rule selection

apply rule to image part of the entity after concating a ten dim vector for step
rule mlp 110 -> 100 dim 

Printing the confusion matrix the network uses one ruke combination for transf combinations that compose to identity
it manages to distinguish the rest transf pairs expect from two that uses the same rule combnation and has not optimal outcome for them.
