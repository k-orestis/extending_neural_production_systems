compMNIST: apply two transformations sequentially to one digit
operation vector: concat 2 4 dim one-hot vactors -> 100 dim rep and them cat it to the digit-entity 
	(4 first dim transformation in first step, 4 second dim transformation in second step)
	
choose rule at each step and expect rule network to add second step information for different second rule selection
apply rule to 200 dim entity
The outcome is the desired, however we print the confusion matrix for true rule combinations and rule combinations selected 
abd it seems that it always chooses one rule combination (however different rules in each steps)
