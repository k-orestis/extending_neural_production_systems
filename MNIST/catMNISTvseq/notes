catMNISTvseq: choose one of three digits and either concat a contextual from right or leave it as it is
	      Then does the same with the entities that occur.
operation vector: 15 dim one-hot to 100 dim rep cat it to the three digit-entities (15 -> 6 triple combinations, 6 pair combinations + 3 digits)
choose rule and primary simultaneously with one attetntion mechanism
choose contextual for the primary with second attetntion mechanism
apply rule to image part of two chosen digit entities
pass the result again to nps and concat again operation rep to each entity
DOes not work well.
